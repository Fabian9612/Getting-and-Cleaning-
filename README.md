
In this course project i included run_analysis.R: 
in the script i read the variables x(measurements), y(activity) and subject, after that i must be bind the data sets and  extract columns named mean and standardt. Extract data by selected columns(from step 3), and merge x, y(activity) and subject data.
Finally generate 'Tidy Dataset' that consists of the average (mean) of each variable for each subject and each activity. The result is shown in the file FinalData.txt.
